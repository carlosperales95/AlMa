When automatically translating from a weakly inflected source language like English to a target language with richer grammatical features such as gender and dual number, the output commonly contains morpho-syntactic agreement errors. To address this issue, we present a target-side, class-based agreement model. Agreement is promoted by scoring a sequence of fine-grained morpho-syntactic classes that are predicted during decoding for each translation hypothesis. For English-to-Arabic translation, our model yields a +1.04 BLEU average improvement over a state-of-the-art baseline. The model does not require bitext or phrase table annotations and can be easily implemented as a feature in many phrase-based decoders.

Our class-based agreement model improves translation quality by promoting local agreement, but with a minimal increase in decoding time and no additional storage requirements for the phrase table. The model can be implemented with a standard CRF package, trained on existing treebanks for many languages, and integrated easily with many MT feature APIs. We achieved best results when the model training data, MT tuning set, and MT evaluation set con
