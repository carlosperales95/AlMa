This paper studies named entity translation and proposes “selective temporality” as a new feature, as using temporal features may be harmful for translating “atemporal” entities. Our key contribution is building an automatic classifier to distinguish temporal and atemporal entities then align them in separate procedures to boost translation accuracy by 6.1

This paper validated that considering temporality selectively is helpful for improving the translation quality. We developed a classifier to distinguish temporal/atemporal entities and our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 6.1%.
