In this paper we study a set of problems that are of considerable importance to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) but which have not been addressed satisfactorily by the SMT research community. Over the last decade, a variety of SMT algorithms have been built and empirically tested whereas little is known about the computational complexity of some of the fundamental problems of SMT. Our work aims at providing useful insights into the the computational complexity of those problems. We prove that while IBM Models 1-2 are conceptually and computationally simple, computations involving the higher (and more useful) models are hard.Since it is unlikely that there exists a poly-language 1 (Tillman, 2001), (Wang, 1997), (Germann et al., 2003), (Udupa et al., 2004). The models are independent of the language pair and therefore, can be used to build a translation system for any language pair as long as a parallel corpus of texts is available for training. Increasingly, parallel corpora are becoming available for many language pairs and SMT systems have been built for French-English, German-English, Arabic-English, Chinese-English, Hindi-English and other language pairs (Brown et al., 1993), (AlOnaizan et al., 1999), (Udupa, 2004). In SMT, every English sentence e is considered as a translation of a given French sentence f withprobability P r (f |e). Therefore, the problem oftranslating f can be viewed as a problem of findingthe most probable translation of f :eâˆ— = argmax P r(e|f ) = argmax P r(f |e)P (e).enomial time solution for any of these harde(1)problems (unless P = NP and P#P = P), our results highlight and justify the need for developing polynomial time approximations for these computations. We also discuss some practical ways of dealing with complexity.

IBM models 3-5 are widely used in SMT. The computational tasks discussed in this work form the backbone of all SMT systems that use IBM models. We believe that our results on the computational complexity of the tasks in SMT will result in a better understanding of these tasks from a theoretical perspective. We also believe that our results may help in the design of effective heuristicsfor some of these tasks. A theoretical analysis of the commonly employed heuristics will also be of interest.An open question in SMT is whether there ex-ists closed form expressions (whose representation is polynomial in the size of the input) for P (f |e)and the counts in the EM iterations for models 3-5 (Brown et al., 1993). For models 1-2, closed formexpressions exist for P (f |e) and the counts in theEM iterations for models 3-5. Our results showthat there cannot exist a closed form expression(whose representation is polynomial in the size of the input) for P (f |e) and the counts in the EMiterations for Models 3-5 unless P = NP.
