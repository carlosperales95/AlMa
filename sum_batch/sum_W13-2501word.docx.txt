We propose a data-driven approach to enhance translation extraction from comparable corpora. Instead of resorting to an external dictionary, we translate source vector features by using a cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation method. The candidate senses for a feature correspond to sense clusters of its translations in a parallel corpus and the context used for disambiguation consists of the vector that contains the feature. The translations found in the disambiguation output convey the sense of the features in the source vector, while the use of translation clusters permits to expand their translation with several variants. As a consequence, the translated vectors are less noisy and richer, and allow for the extraction of higher quality lexicons compared to simpler methods.

We have shown how cross-lingual WSD can be applied to bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora. The disambiguation of source language features using translation clusters constitutes the main contribution of this work and presents several advantages. First, the method performs disambiguation by using sense descriptions derived from the data, which clearly differentiatesour method from the approaches based on external lexicons and extends its applicability to resourcepoor languages. The translation clusters acquired through WSI serve to disambiguate the features in the source language context vectors and to produce less noisy translated vectors. An additional advantage is that the sense clusters often contain more than one translation and, therefore, provide supplementary material for the comparison of the vectors in the target language. The results show that data-driven semantic analysis can help to circumvent the need for an external seed dictionary, traditionally considered as a prerequisite for translation extraction from parallel corpora. Moreover, it is clear that disambiguating the vectors improves the quality of the extracted lexicons and manages to beat the simpler, but yet powerful, most frequent translation heuristic. These encouraging results pave the way towards pure data-driven methods for bilingual lexicon extraction. This knowledge-light approach can be applied to languages and domains that do not dispose of large-scale seed dictionaries but for which parallel corpora are available. An avenue that we intend to explore in future work is to extract translations corresponding to different senses of the headwords. Up to now, research on translation extraction has most often aimed the identification of one good translation for a source word in the comparable corpus. This has also been the case because most works have focused on identifying translations for specialized terms that do not convey different senses. However, words in a general language corpus like Wikipedia can be polysemous and it is important to identify translations corresponding to their different senses. Moreover, polysemy makes the translation extraction procedure more difficult, as features corresponding to different senses are mingled in the same vector. A way to discover translations corresponding to different word senses would be to apply a monolingual WSI method on the source side of the comparable corpus which would group the closely related usages of the headwords together, and to then build vectors for each usage group hopefully describing a distinct sense. Using the generated sets of vectors separately will allow to extract translations corresponding to different senses of the source words.
