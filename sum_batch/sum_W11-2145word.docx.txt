This paper describes the phrase-based SMT systems developed for our participation in the WMT11 Shared Translation Task.Translations for English↔German andEnglish↔French were generated using aphrase-based translation system which isextended by additional models such as bilingual and fine-grained POS language models, POS-based reordering, lattice phrase extraction and discriminative word alignment. Furthermore, we present a special filtering method for the English-French Giga corpus and the phrase scoring step in the training is parallelized.

We have presented the systems for our participation in the WMT 2011 Evaluation for English↔German and English↔French. For English↔French, a spe-cial filtering method for web-crawled data was developed. In addition, a parallel phrase scoring technique was implemented that could speed up the MT training process tremendously. Using these two features, we were able to integrate the huge amounts of data available in the Giga corpus into our systems translating between English and French. We applied POS-based reordering to improve our translations in all directions, using short-range re-ordering for English↔French and long-range re-ordering for English↔German. For German-English, reordering also the training corpus lead tofurther improvements of the translation quality. A Discriminative Word Alignment Model led to an increase in BLEU for English-German. For this direction we also tried fine-grained POS language models of different n-gram lengths. The best translations could be obtained by using 4-grams. For nearly all experiments, a bilingual language model was applied that expands the context of source words that can be considered during decoding. The improvements range from 0.1 to 0.4 in BLEU score.
