 This paper describes the latest version of speech-to-speech translation systems de veloped by the team of NICT-ATR for over twenty years. The system is now ready to be deployed for the travel domain. A new noise-suppression technique notably im proves speech recognition performance. Corpus-based approaches of recognition, translation, and synthesis enable coverage of a wide variety of topics and portability to other languages. 

 This paper presented a speech-to-speech translation system that has been developed by NICT-ATR for two decades. Various techniques, such as noise suppression and corpus-based modeling for both speech processing and machine translation achieve robustness and portability. The evaluation has demonstrated that our system is both effective and useful in a real-world environment.
