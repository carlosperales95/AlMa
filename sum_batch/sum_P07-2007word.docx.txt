This paper describes the latest version of speech-to-speech translation systems developed by the team of NICT-ATR for over twenty years. The system is now ready to be deployed for the travel domain. A new noise-suppression technique notably improves speech recognition performance. Corpus-based approaches of recognition, translation, and synthesis enable coverage of a wide variety of topics and portability to other languages.

 Speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation research started about half a century ago. They have developed independently for a long time until speech-to-speech translation research was proposed in the 1980s. The feasibility of speech-to-speech translation was the focus of research at the beginning because each component was difficult to build and their integration seemed more difficult. After groundbreaking work for two decades, corpus-based speech and language processing technology have recently enabled the achievement of speech-to-speech translation that is usable in the real world. This paper introduces (at ACL 2007) the stateof-the-art speech-to-speech translation system developed by NICT-ATR, Japan.

This paper presented a speech-to-speech translation system that has been developed by NICT-ATR for two decades. Various techniques, such as noise suppression and corpus-based modeling for both speech processing and machine translation achieve robustness and portability. The evaluation has demonstrated that our system is both effective and useful in a real-world environment
