This paper focuses on the Web-based English-Chinese OOV term translation pattern, and emphasizes particularly on the translation selection strategy based on the fusion of multiple features and the ranking mechanism based on Rank ing Support Vector Machine (Ranking SVM). By utilizing the CoNLL2003 corpus for the English Named Entity Recognition (NER) task and selected new terms, the experiments based on different data sources show the consis tent results. Our OOV term translation model can “filter” the most possible translation candidates with better abili ty. From the experimental results for combining our OOV term translation model with English-Chinese Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) on the data sets of Text Retrieval Eval uation Conference (TREC), it can be found that the obvious performance improvement for both query translation and retrieval can also be obtained. 

 In this paper, the proposed model improves the acquirement ability for OOV term translation through Web mining, and solves the translation pair selection and evaluation in a novel way by fusing multiple features and introducing the supervised learning based on Ranking SVM. Furthermore, it is significant to apply the key techniques in machine translation into OOV term translation, such as OOV term recognition, statistical machine learning, alignment of sentence and phoneme, and WSD. All these aspects will be our research focus in the future.
