 We introduce bilingual word embeddings: se mantic embeddings associated across two lan guages in the context of neural language mod els. We propose a method to learn bilingual embeddings from a large unlabeled corpus, while utilizing MT word alignments to con strain translational equivalence. The new em beddings significantly out-perform baselines in word semantic similarity. A single semantic similarity feature induced with bilingual em beddings adds near half a BLEU point to the results of NIST08 Chinese-English machine translation task.
