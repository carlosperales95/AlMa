This paper studies the problem of mining entity translation, specifically, mining English and Chinese name pairs. Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) a transliterationbased approach leveraging phonetic similarity and (b) a corpus-based approach exploiting bilingual co-occurrences, each of which suffers from inaccuracy and scarcity respectively. In clear contrast, we use unleveraged resources of monolingual entity co-occurrences, crawled from entity search engines, represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from two language corpora respectively. Our problem is then abstracted as finding correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal, we propose a holistic approach, of exploiting both transliteration similarity and monolingual co-occurrences. This approach, building upon monolingual corpora, complements existing corpus-based work, requiring scarce resources of parallel or comparable corpus, while significantly boosting the accuracy of transliteration-based work. We validate our proposed system using real-life datasets.

 Entity translation aims at mapping the entity names (e.g., people, locations, and organizations) in source language into their corresponding names in target language. While high quality entity translation is essential in cross-lingual information access and trans lation, it is non-trivial to achieve, due to the challenge that entity translation, though typically bearing pronunciation similarity, can also be arbitrary, e.g., Jackie Chan and fiX :it (pronounced Cheng Long). Existing efforts to address these challenges can be categorized into transliterationand corpusbased approaches. Transliteration-based approaches (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998) identify translations based on pronunciation similarity, while corpus-based approaches mine bilingual co-occurrences of translation pairs obtained from parallel (Kupiec, 1993; Feng et al., 2004) or comparable (Fung and Yee, 1998) corpora, or alternatively mined from bilingual sentences (Lin et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2009). These two approaches have complementary strength– transliteration-based similarity can be computed for any name pair but cannot mine translations of little (or none) phonetic similarity. Corpus-based similarity can support arbitrary translations, but require highly scarce resources of bilingual co-occurrences, obtained from parallel or comparable bilingual corpora. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach, leveraging both transliterationand corpus-based similarity. Our key contribution is to replace the use of scarce resources of bilingual co-occurrences with the use of untapped and significantly larger resources of monolingual co-occurrences for translation. In particular, we extract monolingual cooccurrences of entities from English and Chinese Web corpora, which are readily available from entity search engines such as PeopleEntityCube1, deployed by Microsoft Research Asia. Such engine ∗This work was done when the first two authors visited Mi-	 	 crosoft Research Asia. 1 http://people.entitycube. com  430 Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 430–439, MIT, Massachusetts, USA, 9-11 October 2010. Qc 2010 Association for Computational Linguistics automatically extracts people names from text and their co-occurrences to retrieve related entities based on co-occurrences. To illustrate, Figure 1(a) demonstrates the query result for “Bill Gates,” retrieving and visualizing the “entity-relationship graph” of related people names that frequently co-occur with Bill in English corpus. Similarly, entity-relationship graphs can be built over other language corpora, as Figure 1(b) demonstrates the corresponding results for the same query, from Renlifang2 on Chinese Web corpus. From this point on, for the sake of simplicity, we refer to English and Chinese graphs, simply  0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0  Tail Head    Ours 	Google 	Engkoo as Ge and Gc respectively. Though we illustrate with English-Chinese pairs in the paper, our method can be easily adapted to other language pairs. In particular, we propose a novel approach of abstracting entity translation as a graph matching problem of two graphs Ge and Gc in Figures 1(a) and (b). Specifically, the similarity between two nodes ve and vc in Ge and Gc is initialized as their transliteration similarity, which is iteratively refined based on relational similarity obtained from monolingual cooccurrences. To illustrate this, an English news article mentioning “Bill Gates” and “Melinda Gates” evidences a relationship between the two entities, which can be quantified from their co-occurrences in the entire English Web corpus. Similarly, we can mine Chinese news articles to obtain the re lationships between “t )];·Jli Vi” and “1'1 li\ it·Jli Vi”. Once these two bilingual graphs of people and their relationships are harvested, entity translation can leverage these parallel relationships to further evidence the mapping between translation pairs, as Figure 1(c) illustrates. To highlight the advantage of our proposed approach, we compare our results with commercial machine translators (1) Engkoo3 developed in Microsoft Research Asia and (2) Google Translator4. In particular, Figure 2 reports the precision for two groups– “heads” that belong to top-100 popular people (determined by the number of hits), among randomly sampled 304 people names5 from six graph pairs of size 1,000 each, and the remaining “tails”. Commercial translators such as Google, leveraging 2 http://renlifang.msra.cn 3 http://www.engkoo.com 4 http://translate.google.com 5 See Section 4 for the sampling process. Figure 2: Comparison for Head and Tail datasets bilingual co-occurrences that are scarce for tails, show significantly lower precision for tails. Meanwhile, our work, depending solely on monolingual co-occurrences, shows high precision, for both heads and tails. Our focus is to boost translation accuracy for long tails with non-trivial Web occurrences in each monolingual corpus, but not with much bilingual cooccurrences, e.g., researchers publishing actively in two languages but not famous enough to be featured in multi-lingual Wikipedia entries or news articles. As existing translators are already highly accurate for popular heads, this focus well addresses the remaining challenges for entity translation. To summarize, we believe that this paper has the following contributions: • We abstract entity translation problem as a graph mapping between entity-relationship graphs in two languages. • We develop an effective matching algorithm leveraging both pronunciation and cooccurrence similarity. This holistic approach complements existing approaches and en hances the translation coverage and accuracy. • We validate the effectiveness of our approach using various real-life datasets. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing work. Section 3 then develops our framework. Section 4 reports experimental results and Section 5 concludes our work.

This paper abstracted name translation problem as a matching problem of two entity-relationship graphs. This novel approach complements existing name translation work, by not requiring rare resources of parallel or comparable corpus yet outperforming the state-of-the-art. More specifically, we combine bilingual phonetic similarity and monolingual Web co-occurrence similarity, to compute a holistic notion of entity similarity. To achieve this goal, we de  veloped a graph alignment algorithm that iteratively reinforces the matching similarity exploiting relational similarity and then extracts correct matches. Our evaluation results empirically validated the accuracy of our algorithm over real-life datasets, and showed the effectiveness on our proposed perspective.
