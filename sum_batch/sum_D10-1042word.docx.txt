 This paper studies the problem of mining en tity translation, specifically, mining English and Chinese name pairs. Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) a transliteration based approach leveraging phonetic similar ity and (b) a corpus-based approach exploiting bilingual co-occurrences, each of which suf fers from inaccuracy and scarcity respectively. In clear contrast, we use unleveraged re sources of monolingual entity co-occurrences, crawled from entity search engines, repre sented as two entity-relationship graphs ex tracted from two language corpora respec tively. Our problem is then abstracted as find ing correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal, we propose a holistic ap proach, of exploiting both transliteration sim ilarity and monolingual co-occurrences. This approach, building upon monolingual corpora, complements existing corpus-based work, re quiring scarce resources of parallel or compa rable corpus, while significantly boosting the accuracy of transliteration-based work. We validate our proposed system using real-life datasets.

 This paper abstracted name translation problem as a matching problem of two entity-relationship graphs. This novel approach complements existing name translation work, by not requiring rare resources of parallel or comparable corpus yet outperforming the state-of-the-art. More specifically, we combine bilingual phonetic similarity and monolingual Web co-occurrence similarity, to compute a holistic notion of entity similarity. To achieve this goal, we de    veloped a graph alignment algorithm that iteratively reinforces the matching similarity exploiting relational similarity and then extracts correct matches. Our evaluation results empirically validated the accuracy of our algorithm over real-life datasets, and showed the effectiveness on our proposed perspective.
