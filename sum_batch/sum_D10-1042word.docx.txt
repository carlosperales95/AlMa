This paper studies the problem of mining entity translation, specifically, mining English and Chinese name pairs. Existing efforts can be categorized into (a) a transliterationbased approach leveraging phonetic similarity and (b) a corpus-based approach exploiting bilingual co-occurrences, each of which suffers from inaccuracy and scarcity respectively. In clear contrast, we use unleveraged resources of monolingual entity co-occurrences, crawled from entity search engines, represented as two entity-relationship graphs extracted from two language corpora respectively. Our problem is then abstracted as finding correct mappings across two graphs. To achieve this goal, we propose a holistic approach, of exploiting both transliteration similarity and monolingual co-occurrences. This approach, building upon monolingual corpora, complements existing corpus-based work, requiring scarce resources of parallel or comparable corpus, while significantly boosting the accuracy of transliteration-based work. We validate our proposed system using real-life datasets.

This paper abstracted name translation problem as a matching problem of two entity-relationship graphs. This novel approach complements existing name translation work, by not requiring rare resources of parallel or comparable corpus yet outperforming the state-of-the-art. More specifically, we combine bilingual phonetic similarity and monolingual Web co-occurrence similarity, to compute a holistic notion of entity similarity. To achieve this goal, we de
