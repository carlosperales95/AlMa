 Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is a necessary step in Chinese-English statisti cal machine translation (SMT) and its per formance has an impact on the results of SMT. However, there are many settings in volved in creating a CWS system such as various specifications and CWS methods. This paper investigates the effect of these settings to SMT. We tested dictionary based and CRF-based approaches and found there was no significant difference between the two in the qualty of the result ing translations. We also found the corre lation between the CWS F-score and SMT BLEU score was very weak. This paper also proposes two methods of combining advantages of different specifications: a simple concatenation of training data and a feature interpolation approach in which the same types of features of translation models from various CWS schemes are linearly interpolated. We found these ap proaches were very effective in improving quality of translations. 

 We investigated the effect of CWS on SMT from two points of view. Firstly, we analyzed multiple CWS specifications and built a CWS for each one to examine how they affected translations. Secondly, we investigated the advantages and disadvantages of various CWS approaches, both dictionary-based and CRF-based, and built CWSs using these approaches to examine their effect on translations. We proposed a new approach to linear interpolation of translation features. This approach produced a significant improvement in translation and      achieved the best BLEU score of all the CWS schemes. We have published a much more detailed paper (Zhang et al., 2008) to describe the relations between CWS and SMT.
