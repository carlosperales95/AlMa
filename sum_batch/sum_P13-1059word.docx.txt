We propose a Name-aware Machine Translation (MT) approach which can tightly integrate name processing into MT model, by jointly annotating parallel corpora, extracting name-aware translation grammar and rules, adding name phrase table and name translation driven decoding. Additionally, we also propose a new MT metric to appropriately evaluate the translation quality of informative words, by assigning different weights to different words according to their importance values in a document. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on enhancing the quality of overall translation, name translation and word alignment over a high-quality MT baseline1.

 A shrinking fraction of the worlds Web pages are written in English, therefore the ability to access pages across a range of languages is becoming increasingly important. This need can be addressed in part by cross-lingual information access tasks such as entity linking (McNamee et al 2011; Cassidy et al 2012 event extraction (Hakkani-Tur et al 2007 slot filling (Snover et al 2011) and question answering (Parton et al 2009; Parton and McKeown, 2010 A key bottleneck of highquality cross-lingual information access lies in the performance of Machine Translation (MT Traditional MT approaches focus on the fluency and accuracy of the overall translation but fall short in their ability to translate certain content words including critical information, especially names. 1 Some of the resources and open source programs developed in this work are made freely available for research purpose at A typical statistical MT system can only translate 60% person names correctly (Ji et al 2009 Incorrect segmentation and translation of names which often carry central meanings of a sentence can also yield incorrect translation of long contexts. Names have been largely neglected in the prior MT research due to the following reasons:The current dominant automatic MT scoring metrics (such as Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU Papineni et al 2002 treat all words equally, but names have relative low frequency in text (about 6% in newswire and only 3% in web documents) and thus are vastly outnumbered by function words and common nouns, etc.Name translations pose a greater complexity because the set of names is open and highly dynamic. It is also important to acknowledge that there are many fundamental differences between the translation of names and other tokens, depending on whether a name is rendered phonetically, semantically, or a mixture of both (Ji et al 2009).The artificial settings of assigning low weights to information translation (compared to overall word translation) in some largescale government evaluations have discouraged MT developers to spend time and explore resources to tackle this problem. We propose a novel Name-aware MT (NAMT) approach which can tightly integrate name processing into the training and decoding processes of an end-to-end MT pipeline, and a new name-aware metric to evaluate MT which can assign different weights to different tokens according to their importance values in a document. Compared to previous methods, the novel contributions of our approach are: 1.

We developed a name-aware MT framework which tightly integrates name tagging and name translation into training and decoding of MT. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach over a high-quality MT baseline in both overall translation and name translation, especially for formal genres. We also proposed a new name-aware evaluation metric. In the future we intend to improve the framework by training a discriminative model to automatically assign weights to combine name translation and baseline translation with additional features including name confidence values, name types and global validation evidence, as well as conducting LM adaptation through bilingual topic modeling and clustering based on name annotations. We also plan to jointly optimize MT and name tagging by propagating multiple word segmentation and name annotation hypotheses in lattice structure to statistical MT and conduct latticebased decoding (Dyer et al 2008 Furthermore, we are interested in extending this framework to translate other out-of-vocabulary terms
