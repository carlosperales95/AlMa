We propose a Name-aware Machine Translation (MT) approach which can tightly integrate name processing into MT model, by jointly annotating parallel corpora, extracting name-aware translation grammar and rules, adding name phrase table and name translation driven decoding. Additionally, we also propose a new MT metric to appropriately evaluate the translation quality of informative words, by assigning different weights to different words according to their importance values in a document. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on enhancing the quality of overall translation, name translation and word alignment over a high-quality MT baseline1.

We developed a name-aware MT framework which tightly integrates name tagging and name translation into training and decoding of MT. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach over a high-quality MT baseline in both overall translation and name translation, especially for formal genres. We also proposed a new name-aware evaluation metric. In the future we intend to improve the framework by training a discriminative model to automatically assign weights to combine name translation and baseline translation with additional features including name confidence values, name types and global validation evidence, as well as conducting LM adaptation through bilingual topic modeling and clustering based on name annotations. We also plan to jointly optimize MT and name tagging by propagating multiple word segmentation and name annotation hypotheses in lattice structure to statistical MT and conduct latticebased decoding (Dyer et al., 2008). Furthermore, we are interested in extending this framework to translate other out-of-vocabulary terms.
