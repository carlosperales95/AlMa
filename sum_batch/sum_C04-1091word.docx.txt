The decoding problem in Statistical Ma chine Translation (SMT) is a computation ally hard combinatorial optimization prob lem. In this paper, we propose a new al gorithmic framework for solving the decod ing problem and demonstrate its utility. In the new algorithmic framework, the decod ing problem can be solved both exactly and approximately. The key idea behind the framework is the modeling of the decod ing problem as one that involves alternat ing maximization of two relatively simpler subproblems. We show how the subprob lems can be solved efficiently and how their solutions can be combined to arrive at a so lution for the decoding problem. A fam ily of provably fast decoding algorithms can be derived from the basic techniques under lying the framework and we present a few illustrations. Our first algorithm is a prov ably linear time search algorithm. We use this algorithm as a subroutine in the other algorithms. We believe that decoding algo rithms derived from our framework can be of practical significance. 

 The algorithmic framework developed in this paper is powerful as it yields several decoding algorithms. At one end of the spectrum is a provably linear time algorithm for computing a suboptimal solution and at the other end is an exponential time algorithm for computing  Logscores mada. 2003.

We have also shown that alternating maximization can be employed to come up with O (m2) decoding algorithm. Two questions in this connection are: 1. Is it possible to reduce the complexity of AlternatingSearch to O (m)? 2. Instead of exploring each alignment separately, is it possible to explore a bunch of alignments in one shot? Answers to these questions will result in faster and more efficient decoding algorithms.
