The decoding problem in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is a computationally hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic framework for solving the decoding problem and demonstrate its utility. In the new algorithmic framework, the decoding problem can be solved both exactly and approximately. The key idea behind the framework is the modeling of the decoding problem as one that involves alternating maximization of two relatively simpler subproblems. We show how the subproblems can be solved efficiently and how their solutions can be combined to arrive at a solution for the decoding problem. A family of provably fast decoding algorithms can be derived from the basic techniques underlying the framework and we present a few illustrations. Our first algorithm is a provably linear time search algorithm. We use this algorithm as a subroutine in the other algorithms. We believe that decoding algorithms derived from our framework can be of practical significance.

 Decoding is one of the three fundamental problems in classical SMT (translation model and language model being the other two) as proposed by IBM in the early 1990â€™s (Brown et al., 1993). In the decoding problem we are given the language and translation models and a source language sentence and are asked to find the most probable translation for the sentence. De coding is a discrete optimization problem whose search space is prohibitively large. The challenge is, therefore, in devising a scheme to efficiently search the solution space for the solution. Decoding is known to belong to a class of computational problems popularly known as NPhard problems (Knight, 1999). NP-hard problems are known to be computationally hard and have eluded polynomial time algorithms (Garey and Johnson, 1979). The first algorithms for the decoding problem were based on what is known among the speech recognition community as stack-based search (Jelinek, 1969). The original IBM solution to the decoding problem employed a restricted stack-based search (Berger et al., 1996). This idea was further explored by Wang and Waibel (Wang and Waibel, 1997) who developed a faster stack-based search algorithm. In perhaps the first work on the computational complexity of 

The algorithmic framework developed in this paper is powerful as it yields several decoding algorithms. At one end of the spectrum is a provably linear time algorithm for computing a suboptimal solution and at the other end is an exponential time algorithm for computingNIST Scores7 Logscoresmada. 2003.

We have also shown that alternating maximization can be employed tocome up with O (m2) decoding algorithm. Twoquestions in this connection are:1. Is it possible to reduce the complexity of AlternatingSearch to O (m)?2. Instead of exploring each alignment separately, is it possible to explore a bunch of alignments in one shot?Answers to these questions will result in faster and more efficient decoding algorithms.7
