The decoding problem in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is a computationally hard combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic framework for solving the decoding problem and demonstrate its utility. In the new algorithmic framework, the decoding problem can be solved both exactly and approximately. The key idea behind the framework is the modeling of the decoding problem as one that involves alternating maximization of two relatively simpler subproblems. We show how the subproblems can be solved efficiently and how their solutions can be combined to arrive at a solution for the decoding problem. A family of provably fast decoding algorithms can be derived from the basic techniques underlying the framework and we present a few illustrations. Our first algorithm is a provably linear time search algorithm. We use this algorithm as a subroutine in the other algorithms. We believe that decoding algorithms derived from our framework can be of practical significance.

The algorithmic framework developed in this paper is powerful as it yields several decoding algorithms. At one end of the spectrum is a provably linear time algorithm for computing a suboptimal solution and at the other end is an exponential time algorithm for computingNIST Scores7 the optimal solution. We have also shown that alternating maximization can be employed tocome up with O (m2) decoding algorithm. Twoquestions in this connection are:1. Is it possible to reduce the complexity of AlternatingSearch to O (m)?2. Instead of exploring each alignment separately, is it possible to explore a bunch of alignments in one shot?Answers to these questions will result in faster and more efficient decoding algorithms.7
