 Context-based projection methods for identifying the translation of terms in comparable corpora has attracted a lot of attention in the community, e.g. (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999). Surprisingly, none of those works have systematically investi gated the impact of the many parameters controlling their approach. The present study aims at doing just this. As a test case, we address the task of translating terms of the medical domain by exploit ing pages mined from Wikipedia. One in teresting outcome of this study is that sig nificant gains can be obtained by using an association measure that is rarely used in practice.

 Our results show that using the log-odds ratio as the association measure allows for significantly better translation spotting than the log-likelihood. A closer look at the translation candidates obtained when using LL, the most popular association measure in projection-based approaches, shows that they are often collocates of the reference translation. Therefore, LL may fare better in an indirect approach, like the one in (Daille and Morin, 2005). Moreover, we have seen that the cosine similarity measure and sentence contexts give more LO is used. Indeed, the values of the different parameters influence one another in most cases. Parameters related to the seed lexicon (size, domain specificity) are not of great influence on the performance, but this may in part be due to our resources and the way they were built. The highest Top 1 precision, 55.2 %, was reached with the following parameters: sentence contexts, LO, cosine and a 9,000-entry mixed lexicon, with the use of a cognate heuristic. In future works, other parameters which influence the performance will be studied, among which the use of a terminological extractor to treat complex terms (Daille and Morin, 2005), more contextual window configurations, and the use of syntactic information in combination with lexical information (Yu and Tsujii, 2009). It would also be interesting to compare the projection-based approaches to (Haghighi et al., 2008)’s generative model for bilingual lexicon acquisition from monolingual corpora. One latent outcome of this work is that Wikipedia is surprisingly suitable for mining medical terms. We plan to check its adequacy for other domains and verify that LO remains a better association measure for different corpora and domains.
