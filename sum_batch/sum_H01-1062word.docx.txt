This paper gives an overview of our work on statistical ma chine translation of spoken dialogues, in particular in the framework of the Verbmobil project. The goal of the Verbmobil project is the translation of spoken dialogues in the domains of appointment scheduling and travel plan ning. Starting with the Bayes decision rule as in speech recognition, we show how the required probability distri butions can be structured into three parts: the language model, the alignment model and the lexicon model. We describe the components of the system and report results on the Verbmobil task. The experience obtained in the Verbmobil project, in particular a large-scale end-to-end evaluation, showed that the statistical approach resulted in significantly lower error rates than three competing transla tion approaches: the sentence error rate was 29% in compar ison with 52% to 62% for the other translation approaches. 

 In this paper, we have given an overview of the statistical approach to machine translation and especially its implementation in the Verbmobil prototype system. The statistical system has been trained on about 500 000 running words from a bilingual Germanâ€“English corpus. Translations are performed for both directions, i.e. from German to English and from English to German. Comparative evaluations with other translation approaches of the Verbmobil prototype system show that the statistical translation is superior, especially in the presence of speech input and ungrammatical input.
