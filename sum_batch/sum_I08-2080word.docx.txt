This paper presents an approach that uses structural information for Japanese named entity recognition (NER). Our NER system is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), and utilizes four types of structural informa tion: cache features, coreference relations, syntactic features and caseframe features, which are obtained from structural analyses. We evaluated our approach on CRL NE data and obtained a higher F-measure than exist ing approaches that do not use structural in formation. We also conducted experiments on IREX NE data and an NE-annotated web corpus and conÔ¨Årmed that structural infor mation improves the performance of NER.

 In this paper, we presented an approach that uses structural information for Japanese NER. We introduced four types of structural information to an SVM-based NER system: cache features, coreference relations, syntactic features and caseframe features, and conducted NER experiments on three data. As a consequence, the performance of NER was improved by using structural information and our approach achieved a higher F-measure than existing approaches.
