	An additional advantage be that the sense cluster often contain more than one translation and , therefore , provide supplementary material for the comparison of the vector in the target language .

	In such case , as Hillary Clinton be a famous female leader , she may be associate with other Chinese female leader in Chinese corpus , while such association be rarely observe in English corpus , which cause asymmetry .

	That be , Hillary Clinton be atemporal , as Figure 1 show , such that use such dissimilarity against decide this pair as a correct translation would be harmful .

	We assume here that the MT system be capable of provide word alignment ( or equivalent ) information during decoding , which be generally true for current statistical MT system .

	In such case partial SRSs must be record in such a way that they can be combine later with other partial SRSs .

	1 Some of the resource and open source program develop in this work be make freely available for research purpose at A typical statistical MT system can only translate 60percent person name correctly ( Ji et al 2009 Incorrect segmentation and translation of name which often carry central meaning of a sentence can also yield incorrect translation of long context .

	Still , it be already strike that a direct comparison of them be difficult , if not impossible .

	We show that the algorithmic handle provide by our framework can be employ to develop a very fast decoding algorithm which find good quality translation .

	We show that both of these problem be easy to solve and provide efficient solution for them .

	Moreover , it be clear that disambiguate the vector improve the quality of the extracted lexicon and manages to beat the simpler , but yet powerful , most frequent translation heuristic .

	However , our analysis have show that for Arabic , these genre typically contain more Latin script and transliterated word , and thus there be less morphology to score .

	Finally , we conclude this paper in Section 6 We have show that our cache-based approach significantly improve the performance with the help of various cache , such as the dynamic , static and topic cache , although the cache-based approach may introduce some negative impact onBLEU score for certain documents.In the future , we will far explore how to reflect document divergence during training and dynamically adjust cache weight accord to different documents.There be many useful component in trainingdocuments , such as name entity , event and coreference .

	Thirdly , reference translation of a test document write by human translator tend to have flexible expression in order to avoid produce monotonous text .

	However , there have not be until very recently that the application of mixture modelling in SMT have receive increase attention .

	Although external lexical resource for human reader be potentially good knowledge source , they have not be utilize due to difference in segmentation criterion .

	We show that incorporate lexical weighting feature condition on soft domain membership directly into our model be an effective strategy for dynamically bias SMT towards relevant translation , as evidence by significant performance gain .

	While high quality entity translation be essential in cross-lingual information access and trans lation , it be non-trivial to achieve , due to the challenge that entity translation , though typically bear pronunciation similarity , can also be arbitrary , e.g Jackie Chan and fiX : it ( pronounced Cheng Long Existing effort to address these challenge can be categorize into transliterationand corpusbased approach .

	We believe that by perform a rescoring on translation word graph we will obtain a more significant improvement in translation quality .

	One interesting outcome of this study be that significant gain can be obtain by use an association measure that be rarely use in practice .

	Context-based projection method for identify the translation of term in comparable corpus have attract a lot of attention in the community , e.g Fung ,1998 ; Rapp , 1999 Surprisingly , none of those work have systematically investigate the impact of the many parameter control their approach .

	We believe that decode algorithms derive from our framework can be of practical significance .

	We expect the disambiguation to have a beneficial impact on the result give that polysemy be a frequent phenomenon in a general , mixed-domain corpus .

	However , word in a general language corpus like Wikipedia can be polysemous and it be important to identify translation correspond to their different sens .

	We expect that a method capable of identify the correct sense of the feature and translate them accordingly could contribute to produce cleaner vector and to extract high quality lexicons.In this paper , we show how source vector can be translate into the target language by a cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation ( WSD ) method which exploit the output of data-driven Word Sense Induction ( WSI Apidianaki , 2009 and demonstrate how feature disambiguation enhance the quality of the translation extract from the comparable corpus .

	Our experiment be carry out on the English-Slovene language pair but as the method be totally data-driven , the approach can be easily apply to other languages.The paper be organize as follow : In the next section , we present some related work on bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpus .

	The beauty of the bLSA framework be that the model search for a common latent topic space in an unsupervised fashion , rather than to require manual interaction .

	This paper validate that consider temporality selectively be helpful for improve the translation quality .

	Qc 2012 Association for Computational LinguisticsIt have also be suggest that this setting require morphological generation because the bitext may not Pron + Fem + SgVerb + Masc +3 + PlPrtConj contain all inflected variant ( Minkov et al 2007 ; Toutanova et al 2008 ; Fraser et al 2012 However , use lexical coverage experiment , we show thatit there be ample room for translation quality improvement through good selection of form that already exist in the translation model.they writewilland .

	One problem with the dynamic cache be that those initial sentence in a test document may not benefit from the dynamic cache .

	Another problem be that the dynamic cache may be prone to noise and cause error propagation .

	During last decade , tremendous work have be do to improve the quality of statistical machineCorresponding author .

	As the translation process continue , the dynamic cache grows and contribute more and more to the translation of subsequent sentence .

	Among them , encyclopedias be especially important in that they contain a lot of term that a morphological dictionary fails to cover .

	As hiragana be mainly use to write function word and other basic word , segmentation error concern hiragana often bring disastrous effect on application of morphological analysis .

	We propose an approach that bias machine translation system toward relevant translation base on topic-specific context , where topic be induce in an unsupervised way use topic model ; this can be think of as induce subcorpora for adaptation without any human annotation .

	It be also important to acknowledge that there be many fundamental difference between the translation of name and other token , depend on whether a name be render phonetically , semantically , or a mixture of both ( Ji et al 2009 ) .

	Names have be largely neglect in the prior MT research due to the following reason : The current dominant automatic MT score metric ( such as Bilingual Evaluation Understudy ( BLEU Papineni et al 2002 treat all word equally , but name have relative low frequency in text ( about 6percent in newswire and only 3percent in web document ) and thus be vastly outnumber by function word and common noun , etc.Name translation pose a great complexity because the set of name be open and highly dynamic .

	It can be observe from the experimental result on the data set of Text Retrieval Evaluation Conference ( TREC ) that the obvious performance improvement for query translation can be obtain , which be very beneficial to CLIR and can improve the whole retrieval performance In this paper , the propose model improve the acquirement ability for OOV term translation through Web mining , and solve the translation pair selection and evaluation in a novel way by fuse multiple feature and introduce the supervise learning base on Ranking SVM .
